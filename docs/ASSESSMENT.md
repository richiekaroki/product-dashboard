| UI/UX & Responsiveness     | Mobile-first grid, accessible UI, dark mode |
| Code Readability           | TypeScript, strict mode, reusable components |
| Scalability                | Clear architecture, extendable structure |

## ðŸš€ Notes

- **Client-side filtering** used as per assessment instructions.  
- **Pagination** omitted (all ~100 products fetched at once) â†’ acceptable for dataset size.  
- **Dark mode** added as bonus feature.  
- **Production-ready considerations** (pagination, SSR, testing) documented in `docs/README.md`.
